<h1>Create an online game written in JavaScript</h1>
<h2>Front End Web Developer Project 6</h2>

<h3>JavaScript, JQuery, HTML5, CSS3</h3>


<li>Create an online game written in JavaScript in which 2 players play each turn to compete.</li>
<li>Randomly generate the game map</li>
<li>Weapons will be placed randomly</li>
<li>The placement of the two players is also randomly on the map when the game loads</li>
<li>For each turn, a player can move from one to three boxes (horizontally or vertically) before ending their turn. They obviously can not pass through obstacles directly</li>
<li>If a player passes over a box containing a weapon, they leave their current weapon on site and replace it with the new one</li>
<li>If players cross over adjacent squares (horizontally or vertically), a battle begins.</li>
<li>Each player attacks in turn</li>
<li>The damage depends on the player's weapon</li>
<li>The player can choose to put a shield up or down at the end of their turn. If the shield is up and a battle is instigated they take half damage.</li>
<li>As soon as the life points of a player (initially 100) falls to 0, they lose. A message appears and the game is over.</li>
